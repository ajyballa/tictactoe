First created on 6/14/2022
Code is all self created.

first project using Python, using nothing but Google and documentation. 

This is my first project after learning the fundamentals of Java through school and Python through tutorials. 
I wanted to challenge myself by limiting myself and not using any sort of tutorial, online or through YouTube.
I want to extend of my train of thought by doing this, and hopefully it'll give me a good start and idea of the 
challenges ahead in coding. I also want to start learning how GitJub works initally so this project is a good
learning experience for everything.
